/*
Following lines of code can be used for debugging.
You can use this macro in place of Print.
Advantage of using this is that it only logs while in debugging mode and not while in production/release
mode.
Tip: Just copy and paste this line of code in *.pch file of ur Objective-C project

It prints method name, line of code and function name along with your message.
